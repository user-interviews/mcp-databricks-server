    Provides a detailed description of a specific Unity Catalog table.
    
    Use this tool to understand the structure (columns, data types, partitioning) of a single table.
    This is essential before constructing SQL queries against the table.
    
    Optionally, it can include comprehensive lineage information that goes beyond traditional 
    table-to-table dependencies:

    **Table Lineage:**
    - Upstream tables (tables this table reads from)
    - Downstream tables (tables that read from this table)
    
    **Notebook & Job Lineage:**
    - Notebooks that read from this table, including:
      * Notebook name and workspace path
      * Associated Databricks job information (job name, ID, task details)
    - Notebooks that write to this table with the same detailed context
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - Data impact analysis: understand what breaks if you modify this table
    - Code discovery: find notebooks that process this data for further analysis
    - Debugging: trace data flow issues by examining both table dependencies and processing code
    - Documentation: understand the complete data ecosystem around a table

    The lineage information allows LLMs and tools to subsequently fetch the actual notebook 
    code content for deeper analysis of data transformations and business logic.

    The output is formatted in Markdown.

    Args:
        full_table_name: The fully qualified three-part name of the table (e.g., `catalog.schema.table`).
        include_lineage: Set to True to fetch and include comprehensive lineage (tables, notebooks, jobs). 
                         Defaults to False. May take longer to retrieve but provides rich context for 
                         understanding data dependencies and enabling code exploration.
